      <p class="text-justify">For me, this course has mainly taught me how to do a project with a lot of people from different backgrounds and understand the importance of communication and a well bonding group as the key element of succeeding. It has been great to find out how much help you can get to go forward in a project if you just dare to ask for it.

        <p class="text-justify">The best thing I have learned is to learn from other peers. Even though the topic was attractive at the first time when I heard it, it does not mean that working on it is a joyful thing, instead, when numerous unfamiliar terminologies come right in front of my face, the pressure comes, while it creates stress,  it also motivates me to learn it in any way. In this case, mutual learning, talking and discussing in a group becomes the most efficient way to get to know the project increasingly better; and also it offers me a wider perspective of how to design a subject.

        <p class="text-justify">In this course, I learned that there are many aspects to consider for a real product. Making the prototype working is not the final goal. How to the product easy and comfortable for all the users is also what we have to consider. It is a great experience to work with people from different backgrounds in this course. There are always new things and novel ideas I can learn from them. And I understood the importance of communication in a team.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Obviously I have learned how to work in an international and realistically multidisciplinary environment. Before PDP, multidisciplinary meant mechanical and electrical engineers working together. The wide range of fields has given a wider picture for the project as everybody approaches challenges in different ways. The current world situation has provided great change to learn remote working skills, which will definitely be useful in the future if I am working in an even slightly international project. I have also learned to channel my talkative characteristics to performing and to advance team work by active communication. The most important learning experience for me has been performing in the Halfway Show, where I enjoyed every bit. In addition, the project has taught me to cope with the constantly occurring challenges which sometimes take a lot of time to get solved.

        <p class="text-justify">This course has offered me lots of new skills and tools to work in interdisciplinary and multinational teams. In this product development project, I learned the hard way about the importance of clear communication and good documentation and due to COVID-19, these learning outcomes were emphasized even more. I have always been more systematical than impulsive as a person and I mean by that I need a lot of time for planning before I can act. What I learned from my teammates was that sometimes it is more useful to be bold enough to just push forward than hesitate even if some things might be fuzzy or, everything is not going as planned due to external factors. On the other hand, I hope that my fellow students also learned from me that, sometimes patient planning is more valuable than quick concrete results. All in all, this course has given me unforgettable experiences and opportunities to meet and work with all of these fantastic people. Thank you, PDP! </p>

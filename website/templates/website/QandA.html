    <h2> Frequent Asked Questions </h2>

  <div class="alert mx-5" role="alert">
  <h4 calss="alert-heading">Why are you scanning only the upper part of the body?</h4>
    <hr>
  <p class = "text-justify mx-3" > The most of the vital organs are in the upper body, and those organs having cancer and spreading is the most dangerous. There are also risks in neck area, and in the brain. If the upper body wearable scanner proofs to be effective, those areas could also have their own wearable devices developed.
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h4 calss="alert-heading">Why the radioactive dose is smaller in the wearable than in the traditional scanning device, and why is the wearable scanning for a longer time than the traditional device?
</h4>
  <hr>
<p class = "text-justify mx-3" >The traditional scanning device is very uncomfortable, so being an hour there is already a lot of time. We’re making our device more comfortable to wear, with a lot less claustrophobia. Because it’s possible to wear the device for a couple of hours, we are able to decrease the radiation dose, and with longer scanning time and smaller radiation dose we can still get accurate results. This means that there’s less health risks with the radiation.

  <h4 calss="alert-heading">Is it dangerous to be around a person who is being scanned since they are emitting radioactive radiation?
</h4>
    <hr>
  <p class = "text-justify mx-3" > The overall radioactive dose is so low that it is not even dangerous for the patient themselves. Still, any unnecessary radiation should be avoided. Although most of the radiation is collected by the vest, some might come through and therefore it is suggested to stay out of contact and preferably in a different room than the scanned person. However, occasional closeness and contact wont make any harm.

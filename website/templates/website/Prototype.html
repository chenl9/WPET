        <p class = "text-justify mx-3">Our goal is to make a wearable PET-scanning vest. It would be around 10 kg, and the patient is able to wear it and do some simple daily activities while wearing it.It has a battery and the vest will track relative motion to the patient’s body, so that it would be known, where the detective panels are relative to the body. </p>

        <p class = "text-justify mx-3">In Finland, our team is focusing on the structure, and how to make it as stable, but also as comfortable to wear as possible. We’re also thinking of a possibility to do an aiding device, to take some weight of the vest to help the patient bare the weight.</p>

        <p class = "text-justify mx-3">In Poland, our team members are testing and building electronics for our product. The team is making the electronics with a wetsuit, which is made durable with a tailor, to test a different alternative structure for the wearable PET scanner.</p>
        <p class = "text-justify mx-3">We’re planning to make an app, which gets real time data. The wearable will measure temperature, so that it’s easier to control it. The electronics can measure if there are sudden movements, which would lead to wrong data to the scanning device and the app can take that data away. </p>

          <h4>Handling  the weight </h4>
          <hr>
          <p class = "text-justify mx-3">For making the device a wearable, we have been studying how to make it as easy to bare the weight of the device for the patient as possible. We simulate, how well the weight can be distributed. Also we make sure that the center of the weight should be at the patients spine. Also there could be a possibility to use exoskeleton to bear the weight when the patient would be moving.
          </p>
          <h4>Relative motion</h4>
            <hr>
            <p class = "text-justify mx-3">With sensors, that are stuck to the patient's body and to the vest, we’re able to say if the vest is moving relative to the body. This way we can program the data so, that it changes the placement of where the scanning data is coming from, so the results stay accurate.
